Temporary 10-days GRACE data.

In the actual repository, 10-days GRACE data over Africa (from 2003 to 2012) are available. They have been processed by Dr. G. Ramillien (see Ramillien et al., 2014 in the doc folder) and have been used for the study of Lopez et al., submitted in the Water Resources Research journal in March 2018. 

In the data folder, each .xyz file is an ASCII file with a header (first line) and three columns: [Longitude  Latidude  Equivalent-Water Height (mm)]. The file name is composed of different elements. Explanation with the following file name: solution_contraints_003_AFR+lw_2deg_600km_19542_19551.xyz
	- solution_contraints: name of the data
	- 003: version of the data
	- AFR: Africa 
	- lw: land water
	- 2deg: spatial resolution
	- 600km: 600 km wide Gaussian filter applied to the data
	- 19542_19551: GRACE corresponding cycle, expressed in Julian day since 1950/01/01
